<h2>GraphicRealTime : Graphic automatically updated for Qt using Qthread technologies</h2>
        
<p>For different Qt projects, it is interesting to be able to create and use graphs when we want to do monitoring.
Here in the different codes I provide you can find some examples of graphs.
Usually it works thanks to a second thread that generates the points, this allows to integrate it easily in any single thread or multithreaded project.</p>
        
        - Branch AxisTime : Graph plotting the points received by another thread as a function of time
        - Branch TwoAxes : Graph created from two data sets, they are transmitted using another thread
